<p align="center">This was the repository for the codebase of the system we used at Schaakvereniging De Pion to easily maintain a so-called Keizercompetitie. The website for it made it possible for players to sign up or sign off for multiple rounds at once, for the competition leader to make pairings and so forth. All actions like you can do in Sevilla but then web-based.</p>
